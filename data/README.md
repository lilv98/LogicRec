## Dataset
We provide three processed datasets: Amazon-book, Last-FM, and Yelp2018.
* `train.txt`
  * Train file.
  * Each line is a user with her/his positive interactions with items: (`userID` and `a list of itemID`).
  
* `test.txt`
  * Test file (positive instances).
  * Each line is a user with her/his positive interactions with items: (`userID` and `a list of itemID`).
  * Note that here we treat all unobserved interactions as the negative instances when reporting performance.
  
* `user_list.txt`
  * User file.
  * Each line is a triplet (`org_id`, `remap_id`) for one user, where `org_id` and `remap_id` represent the ID of such user in the original and our datasets, respectively.
  
* `item_list.txt`
  * Item file.
  * Each line is a triplet (`org_id`, `remap_id`, `freebase_id`) for one item, where `org_id`, `remap_id`, and `freebase_id` represent the ID of such item in the original, our datasets, and freebase, respectively.
  
* `entity_list.txt`
  * Entity file.
  * Each line is a triplet (`freebase_id`, `remap_id`) for one entity in knowledge graph, where `freebase_id` and `remap_id` represent the ID of such entity in freebase and our datasets, respectively.
  
* `relation_list.txt`
  * Relation file.
  * Each line is a triplet (`freebase_id`, `remap_id`) for one relation in knowledge graph, where `freebase_id` and `remap_id` represent the ID of such relation in freebase and our datasets, respectively.
